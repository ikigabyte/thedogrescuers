                      <h1> Maggie</h1>
                   <p>Looking for a Netflix buddy – look no further than Maggie, an incredibly sweet 7.5 year old Treeing Walker Coonhound. This pretty girl would love nothing more than to hang out and the latest episodes of your favourite show.  Maggie joined our program in the fall after her owner was admitted into an assisted living facility and this sweet girl found herself with nowhere to go. Maggie is great with other dogs and charms every person she meets. While hanging out watching tv is one of her favourite past times, Maggie won’t be able to join you in sneaking snacks between episodes as this cutie does have some food allergies that her family will need to be on board with continuing to manage</p>
